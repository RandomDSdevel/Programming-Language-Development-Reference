          * [Fixed-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) numbers of, similarly to natural numbers, integers, and other rational numbers, varying [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)), [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable), and [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness)
          * [Floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) numbers of, similarly to natural numbers, integers, and other rational numbers such as fixed-point numbers, varying [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)), [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable), and [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness):  
            * Common [precisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)) and [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable) include:  
              * [Half precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format), consuming 16 bits, or 2 bytes, of backing storage
              * [Single precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format), consuming 32 bits, or 4 bytes, of backing storage
              * [Double precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format), consuming 64 bits, or 8 bytes, of backing storage
              * [Extended-precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision) formats, including, but not limited to:  
                * The [x86 extended-precision format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision#x86_extended_precision_format), consuming 80 bits, or 8.1875 bytes, of backing storage
              * [Quadruple precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format), consuming 128 bits, or 16 bytes, of backing storage
              * [Octuple precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octuple-precision_floating-point_format), consuming 256 bits, or 32 bytes, of backing storage
            * As also explained earlier, [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness) may manifest itself in a data type by making it either of the following possibilities:  
              * Unsigned; able to store only values greater than or equal to 0 (zero) within the precision of the floating-point data type in question
              * Signed; able to represent negative numbers in addition to those representable as unsigned floating-point values within the precision of the backing data type by a shift in the range of values it can store

          These days, most general-purpose computers store floating-point numbers inside their containing data types using the format specified as a standard by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754), which specifies both binary and decimal variants of the various precisions specified above (x86's extended-precision floating-point format being IEEE 754–compatible, of course.)  

      * [Imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number) of, similarly to natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers, varying [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)), [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable), and [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness)
      * <a name="complex-numbers">[Complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number)</a> of, similarly to natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers, varying [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)), [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable), and [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness):  
        * Common [precisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)) and [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_programming)#Range_of_a_variable) include the same ones as those supported by floating-point numbers, as those types are in relatively common use for storing complex numbers' real and imaginary parts.  
        * Again, as also explained earlier, [signedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness) may manifest itself in a data type by making it either of the following possibilities:  
          * Unsigned; able to store only values greater than or equal to 0 (zero) within the precision of the type backing the complex number type in question
          * Signed; able to represent negative numbers in addition to those representable as unsigned complex numeric values within the precision of the backing data type by a shift in the range of values it can store

      (Note that complex numbers are not classified as typical arithemtic types here since their [elementary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Elementary_operations) consist both of member-wise arithmetic on their real and imaginary parts and of more complicated operations involving both their real _and_ their imaginary parts at the same time.)

## Notes

[N. b.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_bene):  Most notes in this document are included inline in parentheses at the end of the bullet-point/-item lines to which they apply.  

### Endnotes

<a name="endnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>The bullet items suffixed with a reference to this endnote are most relevant in the context of [assembly language(s) and machine code](#asm-&amp;-machine-code).  
<a name="endnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>Some child bullet items appear under _both_ the [parent bullet point on data types](#data-types) _and_ [the parent bullet item on type systems](#type-systems).  

### Free-Standing

#### To-Do/Fix-It

* Correct the fact that _one_ of the programming languages in this document is included herein because it was the earliest one to have a 128-bit (possibly extended?) floating-point data type mapped to the underlying [IBM System/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370) hardware, but I can't, for the life of me, remember _which one_ so as to add a corresponding inline note to it in parentheses at the end of its bullet-point/-item line.)  
* Add references to programming-language evolution and purpose manifestos suitable for drawing inspiration from (possibly for improving the documentation behind the rationale for this programming language's conception…?)  
* Add more references to useful examples of code libraries written in other programming languages that might serve as good inspiration for core, standard, and/or common-use libraries that should get created for this one.
